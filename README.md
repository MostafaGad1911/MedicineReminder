MedicineReminder
================

Final project. It uses view pager to split the application into two parts: on the left is a reminder fragment, which enables the user to set the time to take their medicines. Users can add, delete or edit their information. BUG: once in edit mode, once the user clicks cancel, it will delete the reminder. User can set the time to take the medicine. Also, user can choose to set a second reminder. At set time, a notification will be pushed and the phone will vibrate. Once user clicks on the notification, a dialog will confirm with the user if he/she has taken the medicine and will record it to the calendar. If user did not take the medicine on time, a SMS message will be sent to the set number. On the right side of the application is the calendar fragment, and each date can be clicked to check if the medicine has been taken on a specific date. There is a menu item which enables the user to set the number they want to send the SMS message to.
